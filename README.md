# Part-Of-Speech (POS) tagging
Create an Hidden Markov Model whose input is a file containing untagged text and whose output is a file containing each word from the input file, along with the appropriate POS tag.

Train the probability tables (initial, transition and emission) for the HMM before it can do the tagging. The final model can achieve about 90% test accuracy.
